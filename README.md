Simplifying Supply Chain Complexities with Data Analytics


This project focuses on supply chain analytics, where I conducted an in-depth analysis of inefficiencies and developed interactive dashboards. These dashboards provide valuable insights to stakeholders, highlighting potential challenges and offering strategic recommendations for improvement.


Project Overview
This project is based on a real-world supply chain dataset, where I took on the role of a data analyst for Just In Time. My objective was to tackle key challenges in shipment and inventory management, analyze inefficiencies, and create insightful dashboards to help stakeholders make informed decisions and implement business improvements.

Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to enhance supply chain efficiency by addressing critical challenges related to inventory and shipment management. To achieve this, the project is structured into the following key areas:

Methodology
✅ Business Demand Analysis

Develop dashboards to analyze supply chain inefficiencies and identify areas for improvement.
Use descriptive and exploratory analysis for insights.
Tools: Python (Data preprocessing, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis), Tableau (Dashboard visualization)
Business Performance
📊 Dashboard Highlights:

Overall business performance metrics, including profitability, costs, and top-performing products.
Inventory Management
📦 Dashboard Insights:

Warehouse inventory tracking
Supply vs. Demand analysis by product category
Storage costs
Identification of overstocked and understocked products
Shipment Analysis
🚚 Shipping Efficiency Dashboard:

Delayed shipments tracking (percentage of delayed orders, location-based delays)
Most frequently delayed products
Order Fulfillment
✅ Fulfillment Dashboard:

Average warehouse fulfillment rates by product category
The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that not only summarizes key challenges in supply chain operations but also provides data-driven solutions to improve efficiency.

Data Processing & Cleaning
Data preprocessing and cleaning were conducted using Python to ensure high-quality analysis.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of three key tables:
1️⃣ Orders & Shipments – Includes order details such as date, product information, and quantity.
2️⃣ Inventory Data – Tracks warehouse stock levels, storage costs, and fulfillment status.
3️⃣ Order Fulfillment Data – Provides insights into how efficiently products are shipped and delivered.

Key Data Fields:

Customers: Basic details like identifiers and addresses.
Orders: Product orders, quantities, and values.
Shipments: Shipping methods and delivery timelines.
Products: Categorization of items by type and department.
Warehouse Inventory: Monthly stock levels, warehouse locations, and storage costs.
Key Insights
📌 1. Profit & Cost Analysis:

Most profitable product categories and items.
Products with highest profit margins.
Storage cost impact on profitability.
📌 2. Inventory Optimization:

Supply vs. Demand mismatches.
Overstocked product categories leading to excess storage costs.
Understocked items affecting sales opportunities.
📌 3. Shipment Performance:

Identifying shipping delays and their root causes.
Location-based shipment analysis to minimize delays.
📌 4. Order Fulfillment Efficiency:

Analyzing average fulfillment time by product category to improve service levels.

Recommendations for Improvement
✅ Inventory Optimization
To maximize profits and reduce storage costs, inventory levels should be adjusted based on demand trends. Maintaining an optimal stock buffer during peak seasons can help prevent shortages while minimizing excess stock during slow periods.

✅ Better Inventory Distribution
The Fan Shop department often struggles with inventory shortages, leading to missed sales opportunities. A better reallocation strategy across warehouses can help balance inventory levels and reduce shipping delays.

✅ Targeted Marketing Strategy

Promote high-profit-margin products through strategic marketing.
Implement discounts and promotions on top-selling products during peak seasons to maximize revenue.
✅ Reducing Shipment Delays
Further analysis is needed to pinpoint the reasons behind shipment delays. Addressing process inefficiencies and bottlenecks in logistics and fulfillment operations can improve customer satisfaction and delivery speed.

By leveraging data-driven insights, this project helps streamline supply chain operations, enhance decision-making, and boost business efficiency. 🚀
